# Linked List written independently of the List book
Do you see that header up there? That means that this list I've written is trash. <br/>
At least it doesn't leak memory. But I'm sure there are many ways to break it, including using it in <br/>
the only context where it's useful, i.e. in multi-threaded code. It's 200 lines of code, and I hacked <br/>
it out in 2 hours. It means it's _very_ shit. Goodluck, and ciao
